# Case Studies Track

Document how MassGen solves real problems and drive feature development.

**Target Goal:** Self-improvement - every feature should ideally tie to this goal.

---

## Workflow

Case studies drive features, not the other way around.

1. **Identify problems** with current MassGen and long-term goals
2. **Write GitHub issue** for case study (fill out Planning Phase)
3. **Design feature** with dev team
4. **Test feature** on case study
5. **Improve** feature/case study as needed
6. **Run official case study** with video recording
7. **Write case study doc** with video (using Claude Code)

---

## Case Study Issue (Planning Phase)

**Submit GitHub issue first** with label `case study`

[Create case study issue](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/issues/new)

**Required Information:**

- **Prompt** - The task/prompt to test
- **Config file** - Which agents, hyperparameters
- **Cmd** - Command to run
- **Current behavior** - What happens now
- **Expected behavior** - What should happen and why the feature contributes to this
- **How this ties to end goals** - Connection to self-improvement goal

**Template:** [case-study-template.md](https://github.com/massgen/MassGen/blob/main/docs/case_studies/case-study-template.md)

---

## Development Phase

- Interface with dev team creating the feature
- Iterate to address issues revealed by case study
- Test early and often

---

## Evaluation Phase

By release, complete:

1. **Improve the prompt** - Refine in same domain as planning phase
2. **Run the prompt** - With provided cmd and config
3. **Write the report** - Push to GitHub repo by release
4. **Include video** - Record using OBS or Kdenlive

---

## Recording Tools

- **OBS Project:** [obsproject.com](https://obsproject.com/)
- **Kdenlive:** [kdenlive.org](https://kdenlive.org/)

Use Claude Code to write case study documentation.

---

## Timeline

We need to ensure each feature has a defined case study before development starts.

**Case Study Cycle:**

1. **Release day morning (9am PST):** Feature A releases
2. **Same day evening sync (5:30pm PST):** Case study for Feature B must be ready
3. **Next day:** Start developing Feature B

**Schedule:**
- **Monday 9am:** Release → **Monday 5:30pm:** Next case study ready → **Tuesday:** Start development
- **Wednesday 9am:** Release → **Wednesday 5:30pm:** Next case study ready → **Thursday:** Start development
- **Friday 9am:** Release → **Friday 5:30pm:** Next case study ready → **Monday:** Start development
